  <h1>Hey Ya'll, I'm Justin</h1>
  <p>I am a Full Stack Software Developer, graduating from App Academy's Web Development program.</p>
  <p>I love working with JavaScript, React/Redux, Python, and Flask. I am also experienced in HTML and CSS from past projects. Currently, I am working part time as a Software Engineering Assistant for my alma mater, App Academy, as well as volunteering my time as the Web Developer for The Brian Oneill Jr. Foundation. Outside of software engineering, I love sound design and music production, as well as playing action/puzzle games with my friends.</p>
